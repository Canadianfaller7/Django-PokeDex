## Django Checbook
* This is a full-stack site that was made in Django Framework where I used beautifulSoup to scrape the names of Pokemon that you can copy and put into a search bar and then it will use a RESTapi request to get information and a picture of the Pokemon and will then save the API information to a database where you can view the information, edit it, or delete it from the database.
